# Transgres.app

Transgres is a Mac OSX Mountain Lion application which embeds PostgreSQL and a Java environment.
It lives in the menu bar and runs a Postgres server with an extension (pg_jinx) which enables
writing Java stored procedures and foreign data wrappers.

The latest binary version of Transgres is available [here](http://r0kit.s3.amazonaws.com/Transgres.dmg).

Previous versions are also available at the same location by appending the version number
(e.g. [Transgres-2.3.4.dmg](http://r0kit.s3.amazonaws.com/Transgres-2.3.4.dmg) ).
